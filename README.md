  We didnt really find anything confusing

### Part A: Recreate the tests from SDX Ch. 6 in the unittest framework

Write a short description of what you did for Part A below. Some questions you might answer: 
* What was your experience putting the tests in unittest like? 
  I found it interesting organizing the unit tests into one class and using different types of assertion statements.
* How is this different from Greg Wilson's simple implementation? 
    We found it a lot more organized to use the unittest class and not have to individually call the unit tests.
* How is it similar? 
  we are still grouping the test cases but instead of groupig them at the call of the test case we are grouping them on definition
* Why might you use pytest over unittest, or vice versa?


### Part B: Exercises from the end of SDX Ch. 6

Write a short summary of what you did below, with answers to the questions embedded in the exercises.
