_February 6, 2024_

Organization:
* SDX-ch6: The code files for the _SDX Ch.6_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Marlyn, Aiden

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Marlyn
* NAVIGATOR: Aiden

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 6?
* All about testing, and different ways to write test. Pass, fail error. Assertation 
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?
* introspection? A bit confused on pprinting module

### Part A: Recreate the tests from SDX Ch. 6 in the unittest framework

Write a short description of what you did for Part A below. Some questions you might answer: 
* What was your experience putting the tests in unittest like?
* it was good, it was easy writing the tests by themselves, we struggled writing a function that would testv all the tests.
* How is this different from Greg Wilson's simple implementation?
* you have to use the built in modules from unittest, and we dont need a dictionary 
* How is it similar?
* they are siumilar because we still have to define each test and have a function for all the test
* Why might you use pytest over unittest, or vice versa?
* unittest doesnt have extra modules that we need to instal, pytest has more aplication.

### Part B: Exercises from the end of SDX Ch. 6

Write a short summary of what you did below, with answers to the questions embedded in the exercises.

we were only able to add how fast the test ran we used this using (run)
