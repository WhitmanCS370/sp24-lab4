Organization:
* SDX-ch6: The code files for the _SDX Ch.6_ activity (as downloaded directly from the book website, unmodified) 

## Team Members for Part 1
Enter your names 
Terence amd Gabe

## Team Roles for Part 1
Who will start out as
* DRIVER: Gabe
* NAVIGATOR: Terence

You will switch halfway through the _SDX Ch. 3_ activity.

## Part 1 Documentation

Write your answers to the questions below.

* What were the main ideas from SDX chapter 6?
Unit testing, Introspection, looked in to actaully how to do unit testing and they ways in which it is implamented 
* What questions did you have about the material in the chapters? What did you find confusing?

### Part A: Recreate the tests from SDX Ch. 6 in the unittest framework

Write a short description of what you did for Part A below. Some questions you might answer: 
* What was your experience putting the tests in unittest like? 
We followed the code that was provided pretty closly, there were certain things that we were not sure we needed to do that was mostly things that we felt were extra. It seemed fairly simple to convert and use it for the simple casses that we were using but the thing that i can see being helpfull in the future is maybe more complicated systems where there is alot of testing in a row. you can formulate things in a way that is actually beneficial and can communicate all at once.
* How is this different from Greg Wilson's simple implementation? 
this is different from the way that he was doing it because for his code it was difficult to actually see what were the tests that were actually going wrong. In the one we wrote it actually tells you which one is actually correct and wrong. 
* How is it similar? 
it is similar in that it goes through and test every single function that is created and makes it very easy to understand.
* Why might you use pytest over unittest, or vice versa?
some of the benefits that we found for pytest after skimming the site were that it offers more concise testing compared to unittest and really focuses on simplisity and less robustness.

### Part B: Exercises from the end of SDX Ch. 6

Write a short summary of what you did below, with answers to the questions embedded in the exercises.
